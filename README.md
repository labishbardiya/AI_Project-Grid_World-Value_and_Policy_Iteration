# AI_Project-Grid_World-Value_and_Policy_Iteration
This project simulates a Grid World where an agent navigates the environment to maximize its expected rewards using Value Iteration and Policy Iteration algorithms (Markov Decision Process). The agent's goal is to learn the optimal policy that dictates the best action to take in each state to maximize the long-term reward.
